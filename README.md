Overview
--------

This is a small collection of Common Lisp utilities that I use personally.

$ git clone https://github.com/ebzzry/mof ~/common-lisp/mof
```

Then load it with:

```
$ sbcl
* (asdf:make :mof)
```

To list the symbols exported by this package:

```
* (mof:print-symbols :mof)
```

This system uses list comprehensions written by [Sven-Olof NystrÃ¶m](http://user.it.uu.se/~svenolof/).
